RedditImageSaver
================

RedditImageSaver( RIS ) is designed to allow a user
to set a local destination for all images that user
has saved in a particular subreddit, for as many
subreddits as desired.

Example: Say I like to download a lot of wallpapers for use in windows.
(Note: this should work cross-platform, just giving an exmaple because
windows does that neat wallpaper slideshow thing)
I like to keep them organized according to catagory, and those catagories
happen to line up roughly with subreddits.

This utility could be set to download all reddit saved images from the subreddit
/r/spaceporn to E:\user\Pictures\wallpapers\space, and all images from
/r/CityPorn to E:\user\Pictures\wallpapers\urban, etc etc.

Feel free to edit the source, fork, contribute, whatever you want, but please let me know.
